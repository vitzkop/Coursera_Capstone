In my project I will explore the city of Albany, NY
I would explore the city neighborhoods and special locations such as restaurants and hot spots
By understanding their location dispersity I will understand how their density (clusters) differs from each other and then I will try to understand if the citizens of this city tend to leave near hot spots or not
